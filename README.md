# Movie_Recommendation_System
A complete TMDB movie recommendation system project using machine learning 
TMDB Movie Recommendation System

    Data Source: The system pulls movie data from TMDB, which includes information such as titles, genres, plot summaries, and ratings.

    Data Preprocessing: Before processing the data, it undergoes several preprocessing steps, including removing stopwords, punctuation, and special characters. This ensures that the textual data is clean and ready for analysis.

    Natural Language Processing (NLP) Techniques:
        Lemmatization: Words are reduced to their base or dictionary form using lemmatization, helping to standardize words and reduce dimensionality.
        Count Vectorization: Text data is converted into numerical vectors using count vectorization. Each vector represents the count of each word in the document, enabling the machine learning model to work with textual data effectively.

    Streamlit Deployment: Streamlit is used as the web application framework for deploying the movie recommendation system. With Streamlit, users can interact with the system through an intuitive and user-friendly interface. They can input their preferences, search for movies, and explore recommended titles.

    Pickle for Model Persistence: Pickle is utilized for serializing and deserializing the trained machine learning model. This allows the model to be saved to disk and loaded during deployment, ensuring that the recommendation system can use the pre-trained model to generate suggestions without retraining.

    User Experience: Users can easily navigate through the application, search for movies by title, genre, or keywords, and receive personalized recommendations based on their preferences. The system provides detailed information about recommended movies, empowering users to make informed decisions about what to watch next.

    Continuous Improvement: The recommendation system can be continuously improved by incorporating user feedback, refining the machine learning model, and updating movie data from TMDB. Additional features, such as sentiment analysis and user ratings, can enhance the accuracy and relevance of movie recommendations over time.

In summary,TMDB movie recommendation system integrates advanced technologies and user-centric design to deliver a seamless and enjoyable movie discovery experience for users, helping them find new and exciting films to watch.
